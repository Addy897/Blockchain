# Blockchain with Proof of Work

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic blockchain implementation in C with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Each block is mined to meet a specified difficulty level, ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain. The code includes functionalities for block creation, mining, and blockchain management.

## Features

- **Proof of Work**: Implements a mining mechanism that requires solving a cryptographic puzzle.
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Ensures data integrity and security.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Controls the complexity of mining based on the desired difficulty level.
- **Block Creation and Management**: Allows for the addition and printing of blocks in the blockchain.
